# Recipe-Collections
We set up the process of adding Recipes and collections/groups to the app as easy as possible. We use the local file system to create your Recipe groups and .json files to organize all your Recipe properties (such as: Ingredients, Description, Steps, Cooking Time, etc), so you can easily add new Recipes to your app.

Features:
(1) hundreds of thousands of fine recipes, all free to use!
(2) Powerful search to help you find all you want!
(3) Powerful collection function, likes to stay without hesitation!
(4) offer browsing records, seen recipes are here, very intimate!
